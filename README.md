# Thoughtbot Design Challenge
I completed this challenge as a learning activity to enhance my design skills and understand more about Thoughtbot's Design Process.

Thoughtbot is a software design and development agency that builds custom web and mobile products for our clients.

## The Challenge

* 3.5 hours to complete
* There’s usually some Q&A about goals and requirements
* Then whiteboarding or wireframing or prototyping
* This is more to gauge how you approach product design and your UX awareness, than it is about refined layout or styling.

### We are a property management company in New York City, and we are looking to reduce our overall energy consumption to save money and maintain our status as a clean building. Currently we own and manage 6 buildings with about 200 tenants total.

### We believe that if our tenants are more aware of their energy consumption, and pit against each other in a competition to use less energy, they will be motivated to use less. With that in mind, we would like to create a service that allows our tenants to see their energy consumption and the consumption of their neighbors, and then reward the tenants that use the least amount of energy.

### We would like to see a potential solution that would help facilitate this experience for our tenants. Let’s meet at 1pm to discuss further. My expectation is that by 4:30pm, you can present to us a 
* Prototype, 
* Wire frame
* A written solutions or any deliverable that you believe will help us determine what our next steps should be, and if we should work together.

## DESIGN SPRINT PROCESS 
Designed by Thoughtbot https://thoughtbot.com/product-design-sprint/guide

A Product Design Sprint is a technique to quickly design, prototype, and test the viability of an idea, product, or feature. The design sprint consists of 5 phases (typically days), starting with design thinking and ending with a user-tested prototype.

**Phase 0 - Prepare**
* Prior to Design Sprint, send client worksheet to answer the following questions
* Identify 5 users we can test at 30 min intervals during Validation
* Identify at least 3 websites that are competitors similar to your idea
* Conduct at least 3 customer interviews
* Who are the customers?
* What are their stories
* How do they feel about the stated problem
* Existing user stories, wireframes, prototypes, background info

**Phase 1 - Understand**
* Gather existing knowledge, expose assumptions, and unknowns
* Define the business
* Who will use the product?
* How is the product solving a problem that the users have?
* Transparency of energy consumption and usage report
* Holds neighbors accountable 
* In what situation will the user use the product?
* What will motivate them to use it?
* What are outside motivators that might affect their use?
* What don’t we know? Knowledge Gaps
* Research existing research
* Review analysis of competitive products 

**PROCESS TOOLS TO USE**
* Problem Statement
* 5 Whys 
* Who, What, Where, When 
* Research
* Assumptions 
* Needs, Wants, Desires
* Critical Path for problem
  * To be captured at tend of “Understand” phase 

**Phase 2 - Diverge** 
*Illuminate all paths* 

**Phase 3-  Converge** 
*Choose the right path*

**Phase 4 - Prototype**
*Quickly build the right path*

**Phase 5 - Testing**
*Test the right path*
