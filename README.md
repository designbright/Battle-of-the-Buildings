# Battle of the Buildings 

A competition I designed to help communities reduce energy consumption through an incentivizing competition. 

A Product Design Sprint is a technique to quickly design, prototype, and test the viability of an idea, product, or feature. The design sprint consists of 5 phases (typically days), starting with design thinking and ending with a user-tested prototype.

**Phase 0 - Prepare**
* Prior to Design Sprint, send client worksheet to answer the following questions
* Identify 5 users we can test at 30 min intervals during Validation
* Identify at least 3 websites that are competitors similar to your idea
* Conduct at least 3 customer interviews
* Who are the customers?
* What are their stories
* How do they feel about the stated problem
* Existing user stories, wireframes, prototypes, background info

**Phase 1 - Understand**
* Gather existing knowledge, expose assumptions, and unknowns
* Define the business
* Who will use the product?
* How is the product solving a problem that the users have?
* Transparency of energy consumption and usage report
* Holds neighbors accountable 
* In what situation will the user use the product?
* What will motivate them to use it?
* What are outside motivators that might affect their use?
* What don’t we know? Knowledge Gaps
* Research existing research
* Review analysis of competitive products 

**PROCESS TOOLS TO USE**
* Problem Statement
* 5 Whys 
* Who, What, Where, When 
* Research
* Assumptions 
* Needs, Wants, Desires
* Critical Path for problem
  * To be captured at tend of “Understand” phase 

**Phase 2 - Diverge** 
*Illuminate all paths* 

**Phase 3-  Converge** 
*Choose the right path*

**Phase 4 - Prototype**
*Quickly build the right path*

**Phase 5 - Testing**
*Test the right path*
