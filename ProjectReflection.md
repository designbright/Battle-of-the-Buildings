# PROJECT REFLECTION 

## Challenges 
* Understanding Thoughtbot’s Design Process flow took some time, but I was very intentional with my approach to problem solving and learning the Thoughbot way
* Needed to learn new tools such as InVision and Flinto for Prototyping
* Completed this project individually. It was designed to be used in a group setting so I had to extrapolate many of the client’s problems 
* I have never designed for a property management company so I made sure to spend time researching environmental practices and how property companies can go green. 
* Since I was completing this individually, not all of the exercises for each phase of the design process felt applicable. Example, any exercise that required group interaction.

## Lessons Learned 
* “Don’t let perfection be the enemy of good” - I need to learn how to budget my time better in terms of wanting to boil the ocean with ideas. This can prevent me from actually completing the project on time.  I know this will come with more experience and direction
* Prototyping tools are amazing!!! I had so much fun researching and learning new tools 
* I am actually implementing some of the “Green” initiatives in my own day-to-day life such as turning off lights and unplugging appliances when not in use
* Mobile-first design - I typically don’t design mobile first so this was a fun, new challenge

## Project Strengths
* I was incredibly impressed with Thoughtbot’s approach to teaching and documenting processes. This is something that typically falls by the wayside in many companies. 
* I was able to complete my project because Thoughtbot set me up for success. 
* The process was very simple to follow and I had all the resources I needed in one place. The instructions were clear and formatted in a way that was not overwhelming. 
Trello board was a great tool that Thoughbot put together

## Project Improvements - The Roadmap
* Improve High Fidelity Prototype (if applicable)
* Gather feedback
